# Air Quality System - Gateway DTN -> HTTP
A gateway to convert sensor nodes readings received via DTN to HTTP POST requests. It is similar to the work made in the project (fog-over-dtn)[https://github.com/netgroup-polito/fog-over-dtn] (The rights of the original code belongs to the owners, since it is GPLv3 licensed), but implemented in python 3 and adapted for the use cases of this project.
