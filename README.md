# gateway-air-quality-system
A gateway to convert sensor nodes messages received via DTN to MQTT publish messages. It is a clone of the work made in the project (fog-over-dtn)[https://github.com/netgroup-polito/fog-over-dtn] but implemented in python 3 (since the original was implemented using python 2.x which will not be maintained past 2020)
